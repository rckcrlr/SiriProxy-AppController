My code is embeded in the siriproxy-example.rb file at the moment.  Now I'm working on pulling it out into it's own gem for config.yml support.  Stay Tuned.


Installation:

Assumption - You already have SiriProxy installed and functioning properly.  See instruction at: https://github.com/plamoni/SiriProxy

1) copy app_controller.rb to ~siriproxy_root/lib/

2) Save original siriproxy-example.rb to something like siriproxy-example-orig.rb

3) copy siriproxy-example.rb to ~siriproxy_root/plugins/siriproxy-example/lib/

Supported apps:
	iTunes
	Plex
	iCamSource

Supported Voice Commands:
	"Start <appname>"
	"Stop <appname>"
	"Status of <appname>"

iTunes and Plex can be called by name.  iCamSource's voice command is "webcam" instead of "icamsource" as it just makes more sense to call it a webcam.
